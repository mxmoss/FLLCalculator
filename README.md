# About
From the [FLL site](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge):

Every year, FIRSTÂ® LEGO League releases a Challenge, which is based on a real-world scientific topic. Each Challenge has three parts: the Robot Game, the Project, and the Core Values. Teams of up to ten children, with at least two adult coaches, participate in the Challenge by programming an autonomous robot to score points on a themed playing field (Robot Game), developing a solution to a problem they have identified (Project), all guided by the FIRST LEGO League Core Values. Teams may then attend an official tournament, hosted by our FIRST LEGO League Partners.

1.  Separate the data from the challenges so the calculator can be easily updated each new FLL season
1.  Learn more about Bootstrap formatting
1.  Better understand React forms
